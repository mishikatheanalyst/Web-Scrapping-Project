# Web-Scrapping-Project
This is a web scrapping project that uses Python 3.9 to scrape the list of product name, their prices and rating from a website and save it in an excel file.

The website link is here :
https://www.flipkart.com/search?q=iphone&otracker=search&otracker1=search&marketplace=FLIPKART&as-show=on&as=off&page=1

The code has been further customised to only retrieving products with 4.5+ rating.
